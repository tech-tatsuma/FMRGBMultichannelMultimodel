# FMRGBMultichannelMultimodel(Binary Problem Version)
The model is trained by creating video data with sound frequencies and amplitudes and image RGB information as channels.
The network uses a three-dimensional convolutional neural network and convLSTM neural network.

## Usage
### resize mp4 data
```
python resize_video.py --target <targetfolder> --mag <degree of resolution reduction>
```
When the mag is 3, the vertical and horizontal resolution is 1/3 each.

### delete not resized mp4 data
```
python delete_not_resized.py --target <targetfolder>
```
Delete all unresized mp4 data in the target folder.

### Creation of data sets
```
python create_fmrgbdata.py --target <data folder> --audiomethod <simple or mel> --frequency_param <Frequency analysis parameters（int）> --fmrgb <3 or 5 channels>
```
target: Specification of the directory containing the video data (pt format data) to be converted to fmrgb data.

audiomethod: Option to analyse audio data with a simple spectrogram or with a melspectrogram.

frequency_param: Parameters used for frequency analysis. Specified as integer type.
    
### delete all mp4 data
```
python delete_allmp4.py --target <target folder>
```
Delete all mp4 data in the target folder.
This is useful to reduce the capacity in the folder.

### Data visualisation
```
python visualize.py --target <ptファイル>
```
Program to visualise 5 channel pt data.
### FMRGB multi-channel model training.
```
python train.py --data <csvデータ> --epochs <学習回数> --test_size <テストデータの割合指定> --patience <早期終了パラメータ> --learnmethod <conv3d or convlstm or vivit> --islearnrate_search <true or false>
```
Main program to train data. In this program, dataset.py and model.py are called and use them effeciently.
In the model.py, conv3d and convlstm are defined. You can specify the method by using the learnmethod option.
##  Explanation of the program
### Imaging of audio data
SIMPLE SPECTROGRAM

1. Calculation of the STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform)：The librosa.stft(audio_samples) function is used to perform a short-time Fourier transform. It divides the audio signal into small chunks (frames) and applies the Fourier transform to each frame to produce a complex result.

2. Calculation of spectrograms：np.abs() is used to calculate an amplitude spectrogram from the STFT results. This shows the amplitude of the audio signal at each frame and frequency.

3. The frequencies with the highest amplitude are taken from the results calculated in 2.

4. The results calculated by the above methods are scaled to 0~255 and embedded in the image.

MELSPECTROGRAM

1. Samples audio data at a constant frequency based on the video frame rate.

2. Use librosa.feature.melspectrogram to compute the melspectrogram of the speech data.

3. Save the melspectrogram as an image and save its value as a NumPy array as the fifth channel image.

### How to align data lengths
1. Examines all videos in the directory and retrieves the frame count of the video with the highest frame count.

2. The number of frames is then resized to the maximum number of frames if the number of frames in the video is less than the maximum number of frames when each video is processed. The scipy.ndimage.zoom function is used for resizing. This function scales up or down each dimension of the input array based on a specific zoom factor. The zoom factor is calculated by dividing the current number of frames by the maximum number of frames.
